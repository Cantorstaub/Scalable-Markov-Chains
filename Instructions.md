To use the Scalable Markov Chains program and to create output texts, please follow these instructions.

The instructions are designed with newcomers to Python and programming in mind.

You need Python 3 installed on your computer to execute the program.

## Preparations

1) __Choose or create a folder__ on your hard drive where you want to store the program. You can name it any way you want, e.g., `Markov-Chains_Python`.

2) Either a) __download the program__ from GitHub by loading the file `SMC_Program.py` to the folder created in step 1. Or b) __create a new file__ within the folder created in step 1. Save the file under the name `SMC_Program.py`. It is essential to type the name without any deviations or errors. Then you __copy the contents__ of the same-named file `SMC_Program.py` from GitHub into the file you just created and __save the file__ after doing this. To create the file, you can use almost any text editor. My personal choice is the text editor _Sublime_, which you can download and use for free (I am not affiliated with them by any means).

3) __Create the input file__ `input.txt`. This file will contain the text the program uses to learn the probabilities for symbols following one another. Here, again, you can use any text editor of your choosing. You can, of course, use the editor _Sublime_ mentioned in step 2. __Open a new file__ in your text editor and __save the file__ to the folder created in step 1 under the name `input.txt`. As before, it is crucial to type the name without any deviations or errors. Otherwise, the program will not be able to open the input file later on. It is also essential that the file `SMC_Program.py` containing the program and the input file you just created __are in the same folder__. For now, the file is empty. But we are going to change that:

4) __Copy some text__ into the input file `input.txt` you have created in step 3. What kind of text that is, is up to you. It is advisable to use long texts as input, e.g., the content of a whole book. You can, of course, start with some short random text (like even `asdfasdf`) to test the functionality of the program in your setting. After copying the text into `input.txt`, __save the file__.

## Executing the Program

5) To execute the program, you have to __open the console__: a) On Windows Systems, in the search bar at the bottom left, type `PowerShell` and then start PowerShell. b) On Mac OS, press `Command + Space` to open the search bar. Here, type `terminal` and start the terminal.

6) In the console of your system opened in step 5, we now have to __navigate to the folder__ you have created in step 1. This is the folder where the two files, `SMC_Program.py` from step 2 and `input.txt` from step 3, are stored. To navigate to this folder, you need to know its location on your hard drive. This means you need to know the path where the folder is located. Using this information, we will open folder by folder within the console until we are inside the folder you created. If needed, use the command `ls` followed by hitting `Enter` to see the contents of the folder you are currently in. This might help to determine which folder to open next to eventually come to the folder with the program file in it. To open a specific folder, type `cd` followed by the name of the folder you want to open. (For example, to open the folder `Documents`, type `cd Documents `. Of course, this arbitrary example only works if the folder you are currently in contains a folder named `Documents`.) Again, use the command `ls` to check the contents of the folder you are currently in. If you have to close a folder and go one level up again, use the command `cd ..`. By using these commands, you should be able to navigate to the folder you created in step 1. If you have reached and opened this folder, type `ls` once again. If the files `SMC_Program.py` and `input.txt` are in this folder, you have done everything right. If they aren’t, check a) if you are in the correct folder in the console, and b) if you have created these files in the correct folder in steps 2 and 3.

7) If you have navigated to the correct folder within the console successfully, you are ready to __start the program__. In the console, type `python SMC_Program.py`. Again, every single sign has to be correct in order to execute the program stored under the name `SMC_Program.py`. If you are sure you have typed the correct command, hit `Enter`. If everything worked out fine, depending on the current parameters of the program (more about that in the following steps 9 to __X__), the console will show some info on the parameters chosen and present to you the result we wanted: Some randomly created output text. It might also be the case that you encounter an error. There are many reasons for this. I will discuss one of the most fundamental ones in the following step 8.

8) If the program has worked, you can proceed to step 9. If it has not, you have to do some __troubleshooting__. One of the most basic issues to check is whether the command `python` that you used when trying to start the program in step 7 is the correct one for your computer. If, on Windows, instead of delivering the desired output, the console responded to you with something like `` – or on Mac OS with something like `python: command not found` –, you might have to use a different command to tell the computer to start Python. On Windows, instead of the command from step 7, try just `py SMC_Program.py`. On Mac, try `python3 SMC_Program.py`. If this is not getting you the correct outcome, copy the error message from the console and search online for a solution. This kind of troubleshooting is part of learning how to program (and of programming itself), and by no means an indicator of your ability to master it.
