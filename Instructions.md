To use the Scalable Markov Chains program and to create output texts, please follow these instructions.

The instructions are designed with newcomers to Python and programming in mind.

## Preparations

1) Choose or create a folder on your hard drive where you want to store the program.

2) Either a) __download the program__ from GitHub by loading the file `SMC_Program.py` to the folder created in step 1. Or b) __create a new file__ within the folder created in step 1. Save the file under the name `SMC_Program.py`. It is essential to type the name without any deviations or errors. Then you __copy the contents__ of the same-named file `SMC_Program.py` from GitHub into the file you just created and __save the file__ after doing this. To create the file, you can use almost any text editor. My personal choice is the text editor _Sublime_, which you can download and use for free (I am not affiliated with them by any means).

3) __Create the input file__ `input.txt`. This file will contain the text the program uses to learn the probabilities for symbols following one another. Here, again, you can use any text editor of your choosing. You can, of course, use the editor _Sublime_ mentioned in step 2. __Open a new file__ in your text editor and __save the file__ to the folder created in step 1 under the name `input.txt`. As before, it is crucial to type the name without any deviations or errors. Otherwise, the program will not be able to open the input file later on. It is also essential that the file `SMC_Program.py` containing the program and the input file you just created __are in the same folder__. For now, the file is empty. But we are going to change that:

4) __Copy some text__ into the input file `input.txt` you have created in step 3. What kind of text that is, is up to you. It is advisable to use long texts as input, e.g., the content of a whole book. You can, of course, start with some short random text (like even `asdfasdf`) to test the functionality of the program in your setting. After copying the text into `input.txt`, __save the file__.
