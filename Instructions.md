To use the Scalable Markov Chains program and to create output texts, please follow these instructions.

## Preparations

1) Choose or create a folder on your hard drive where you want to store the program.

2) _Either_ download the program from GitHub by loading the file `SMC_Program.py` to the folder created in step 1. _Or_ create a new file within the folder created in step 1. Save the file under the name `SMC_Program.py`. It is important to type the name without any deviations or errors. Then you can copy the contents of the same-named file from GitHub into the file you created, and you _save_ the file after doing this. To create the file, you can use almost any text editor. My personal choice is the text editor _Sublime_, which you can download and use for free (I am not affiliated with them by any means).

3) Create the input file. This file will contain the text the program uses to learn the probabilities for symbols following one another. Here, again, you can use any text editor of your choosing. You can, of course, use the editor _Sublime_ mentioned in step 2. Open a new file in your text editor and save the file to the folder created in step 1 under the name `input.txt`. As before, it is crucial to type the name without any deviations or errors. Otherwise, the program will not be able to open the input file later on.

4) Copy some text into the file `input.txt` you have created in step 3. What kind of text that is, is up to you. It is advisable to use long texts as input, e.g., the content of a whole book. You can, of course, start with some short random text (like even `asdfasdf`) to test the functionality of the program in your setting. After copying the text into `input.txt`, save the file.
