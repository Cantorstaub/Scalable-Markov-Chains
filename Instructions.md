To use the Scalable Markov Chains program and to create your own ouptut texts, please follow these instructions.

1) Choose or create a folder on your harddrive where you want to store the program.

2) Either download the program from Github by loading the file `SMC_Program.py`. Or create a new file within the folder created in step 1. Save the file under the name `SMC_Program.py` and copy the contents of the same named file from Github into your file. To create the file you can almost every text editor. My personal choice is the text editor _Sublime_, which you can download and use for free.

3) Create the input-file.
